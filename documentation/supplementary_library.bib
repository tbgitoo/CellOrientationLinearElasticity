The user can decide which degree of automatisation is required and thus allows for either a more custom-like or black-box-like behaviour of the software. We discuss the automatic generation of first and second order shape derivatives for unconstrained model problems as well as for more realistic problems that are constrained by different types of partial differential equations. We consider linear as well as nonlinear problems and also problems which are posed on surfaces. In numerical experiments we verify the accuracy of the computed derivatives via a Taylor test. Finally we present first and second order shape optimisation algorithms and illustrate them for several numerical optimisation examples ranging from nonlinear elasticity to Maxwell's equations.},

	abstract = {The main goal of this work is the generation of ground-truth data for the validation of atrophy measurement techniques, commonly used in the study of neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia. Several techniques have been used to measure atrophy in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, but it is extremely difficult to compare their performance since they have been applied to different patient populations. Furthermore, assessment of performance based on phantom measurements or simple scaled images overestimates these techniques' ability to capture the complexity of neurodegeneration of the human brain. We propose a method for atrophy simulation in structural magnetic resonance (MR) images based on finite-element methods. The method produces cohorts of brain images with known change that is physically and clinically plausible, providing data for objective evaluation of atrophy measurement techniques. Atrophy is simulated in different tissue compartments or in different neuroanatomical structures with a phenomenological model. This model of diffuse global and regional atrophy is based on volumetric measurements such as the brain or the hippocampus, from patients with known disease and guided by clinical knowledge of the relative pathological involvement of regions and tissues. The consequent biomechanical readjustment of structures is modelled using conventional physics-based techniques based on biomechanical tissue properties and simulating plausible tissue deformations with finite-element methods. A thermoelastic model of tissue deformation is employed, controlling the rate of progression of atrophy by means of a set of thermal coefficients, each one corresponding to a different type of tissue. Tissue characterization is performed by means of the meshing of a labelled brain atlas, creating a reference volumetric mesh that will be introduced to a finite-element solver to create the simulated deformations. Preliminary work on the simulation of acquisition artefacts is also presented. Cross-sectional and longitudinal sets of simulated data are shown and a visual classification protocol has been used by experts to rate real and simulated scans according to their degree of atrophy. Results confirm the potential of the proposed methodology.},

These kinetics are motivated by considering the enthalpies of the actin/myosin functional units that constitute the stress fibers. The stress, strain and strain rate dependence of the stress-fiber dynamics are natural outcomes of the approach. The model is presented in a general 3D framework and includes the transport of the unbound stress-fiber proteins. Predictions of the model for a range of cyclic loadings are illustrated to rationalize hitherto apparently contrasting observations. These observations include: (1) For strain amplitudes around 10 \% and cyclic frequencies of about 1 Hz, stress fibers align perpendicular to the straining direction in cells subjected to cyclic straining on a 2D substrate while the stress fibers align parallel with the straining direction in cells constrained in a 3D tissue. (2) At lower applied cyclic frequencies, stress fibers in cells on 2D substrates display no sensitivity to symmetric applied strain versus time waveforms but realign in response to applied loadings with a fast lengthening rate and slow shortening. (3) At very low applied cyclic frequencies (on the order of mHz) with symmetric strain versus time waveforms, cells on 2D substrates orient perpendicular to the direction of cyclic straining above a critical strain amplitude.},

	abstract = {Alignment of cells in response to mechanical cues plays an important role in a wide range of physiologic processes. Multiple cell types orient perpendicular to applied cyclic stretch in 2D culture but parallel to stretch in 3D culture, and the mechanisms underlying this behavior remain elusive. We tested a promising hypothesized mechanism called strain avoidance and showed that it cannot explain cell alignment across the conditions that we examined. By contrast, a computational model of stress fiber kinetics incorporating the influence of traction boundary conditions and altered strain transmission in soft gels reproduced all of our experimental results as well as published 2D stretch experiments. These findings could improve understanding, modeling, and therapeutic modulation of tissue development, regeneration, and repair. The ability of cells to orient in response to mechanical stimuli is essential to embryonic development, cell migration, mechanotransduction, and other critical physiologic functions in a range of organs. Endothelial cells, fibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, and osteoblasts all orient perpendicular to an applied cyclic stretch when plated on stretchable elastic substrates, suggesting a common underlying mechanism. However, many of these same cells orient parallel to stretch in vivo and in 3D culture, and a compelling explanation for the different orientation responses in 2D and 3D has remained elusive. Here, we conducted a series of experiments designed specifically to test the hypothesis that differences in strains transverse to the primary loading direction give rise to the different alignment patterns observed in 2D and 3D cyclic stretch experiments (“strain avoidance”). We found that, in static or low-frequency stretch conditions, cell alignment in fibroblast-populated collagen gels correlated with the presence or absence of a restraining boundary condition rather than with compaction strains. Cyclic stretch could induce perpendicular alignment in 3D culture but only at frequencies an order of magnitude greater than reported to induce perpendicular alignment in 2D. We modified a published model of stress fiber dynamics and were able to reproduce our experimental findings across all conditions tested as well as published data from 2D cyclic stretch experiments. These experimental and model results suggest an explanation for the apparently contradictory alignment responses of cells subjected to cyclic stretch on 2D membranes and in 3D gels.},

The study of the influence of patterned substrates on cells, named contact guidance, has greatly benefited from the development of micro and nano-fabrication techniques, allowing the emergence of increasingly diverse and elaborate engineered platforms. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive view of the process of contact guidance from cellular to subcellular scales. We first classify and illustrate the large diversity of topographies reported in the literature by focusing on generic cellular responses to diverse topographical cues. Subsequently, and in a complementary fashion, we adopt the opposite approach and highlight cell type-specific responses to classically used topographies (arrays of pillars or grooves). Finally, we discuss recent advances on the key subcellular and molecular players involved in topographical sensing. Throughout the review, we focus particularly on neuronal cells, whose unique morphology and behavior have inspired a large body of studies in the field of topographical sensing and revealed fascinating cellular mechanisms. We conclude by using the current understanding of the cell-topography interactions at different scales as a springboard for identifying future challenges in the field of contact guidance.},

	abstract = {Directed cell migration mediates physiological and pathological processes. In particular, immune cell trafficking in tissues is crucial for inducing immune responses and is coordinated by multiple environmental cues such as chemoattractant gradients. Although the chemotaxis mechanism has been extensively studied, how cells integrate multiple chemotactic signals for effective trafficking and positioning in tissues is not clearly defined. Results from previous neutrophil chemotaxis experiments and modeling studies suggested that ligand-induced homologous receptor desensitization may provide an important mechanism for cell migration in competing chemoattractant gradients. However, the previous mathematical model is oversimplified to cell gradient sensing in one-dimensional (1-D) environment. To better understand the receptor desensitization mechanism for chemotactic navigation, we further developed the model to test the role of homologous receptor desensitization in regulating both cell gradient sensing and migration in different configurations of chemoattractant fields in two-dimension (2-D). Our results show that cells expressing normal desensitizable receptors preferentially orient and migrate toward the distant gradient in the presence of a second local competing gradient, which are consistent with the experimentally observed preferential migration of cells toward the distant attractant source and confirm the requirement of receptor desensitization for such migratory behaviors. Furthermore, our results are in qualitative agreement with the experimentally observed cell migration patterns in different configurations of competing chemoattractant fields.},

	abstract = {Cells contracting in extracellular matrix (ECM) can transmit stress over long distances, communicating their position and orientation to cells many tens of micrometres away. Such phenomena are not observed when cells are seeded on substrates with linear elastic properties, such as polyacrylamide (PA) gel. The ability for fibrous substrates to support far reaching stress and strain fields has implications for many physiological processes, while the mechanical properties of ECM are central to several pathological processes, including tumour invasion and fibrosis. Theoretical models have investigated the properties of ECM in a variety of network geometries. However, the effects of network architecture on mechanical cell–cell communication have received little attention. This work investigates the effects of geometry on network mechanics, and thus the ability for cells to communicate mechanically through different networks. Cell-derived displacement fields are quantified for various network geometries while controlling for network topology, cross-link density and micromechanical properties. We find that the heterogeneity of response, fibre alignment, and substrate displacement fields are sensitive to network choice. Further, we show that certain geometries support mechanical communication over longer distances than others. As such, we predict that the choice of network geometry is important in fundamental modelling of cell–cell interactions in fibrous substrates, as well as in experimental settings, where mechanical signalling at the cellular scale plays an important role. This work thus informs the construction of theoretical models for substrate mechanics and experimental explorations of mechanical cell–cell communication.},

The aim is to delimit the domain of validity of the major nanoelectrostatic models, and in particular to assess the influence of hydrogel chain mobility on ionic partition. We find that the widely used Gibbs-Donnan model greatly overestimates exclusion of the co-ion probes used. For low molecular weight probes, a much better fit is obtained by taking into account the electrostatics in the nanometric gel pores by means of the Poisson-Boltzmann framework; the fit is improved slightly when taking into account alginate chain mobility. For high molecular weight probes, we find it essential to take into account local gel deformation due to electrostatic repulsion between the flexible gel strands and the probe. This is achieved by combining Poisson-Boltzmann simulations with heterogeneous pore size distribution given by the Ogston model, or more simply and precisely, by applying a semi-empirical scaling law involving the ratio between Debye length and pore size.},

The suitability of engineered heart tissue (EHT) for both in vitro and in vivo applications will depend on the degree of syncytoid tissue formation and cardiac myocyte differentiation in vitro, contractile function, and electrophysiological properties. Here, we demonstrate that cardiac myocytes from neonatal rats, when mixed with collagen I and matrix factors, cast in circular molds, and subjected to phasic mechanical stretch, reconstitute ring-shaped EHTs that display important hallmarks of differentiated myocardium. Comparative histological analysis of EHTs with native heart tissue from newborn, 6-day-old, and adult rats revealed that cardiac cells in EHTs reconstitute intensively interconnected, longitudinally oriented, cardiac muscle bundles with morphological features resembling adult rather than immature native tissue. Confocal and electron microscopy demonstrated characteristic features of native differentiated myocardium; some of these features are absent in myocytes from newborn rats: (1) highly organized sarcomeres in registry; (2) adherens junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes; (3) a well-developed T-tubular system and dyad formation with the sarcoplasmic reticulum; and (4) a basement membrane surrounding cardiac myocytes. Accordingly, EHTs displayed contractile characteristics of native myocardium with a high ratio of twitch (0.4 to 0.8 mN) to resting tension (0.1 to 0.3 mN) and a strong beta-adrenergic inotropic response. Action potential recordings demonstrated stable resting membrane potentials of -66 to -78 mV, fast upstroke kinetics, and a prominent plateau phase. The data indicate that EHTs represent highly differentiated cardiac tissue constructs, making EHTs a promising material for in vitro studies of cardiac function and tissue replacement therapy.},

	abstract = {Aclassic model for tissue morphogenesis is the formation of ligament-like straps between explants of fibroblasts placed in collagen gels. The patterns arise from mechanical forces exerted by cells on their substrates (Harris et al., 1981). However, where do such straps come from, and how are slow local movements of cells transduced into dramatic long-distance redistributions of collagen? We embedded primary mouse skin and human periodontal ligament fibroblasts in collagen gels and measured the time course of patterning by using a novel computer algorithm to calculate anisotropy, and by tracking glass beads dispersed in the gel. As fibroblasts began to spread into their immediate environments, a coordinated rearrangement of collagen commenced throughout the gel, producing a strap on a time scale of minutes. Killing of cells afterwards resulted in a partial relaxation of the matrix strain. Surprisingly, relatively small movements of collagen molecules on the tensile axis between two pulling explants induced a much larger concomitant compression of the gel perpendicular to the axis, organizing and aligning fibers into a strap. We propose that this amplification is due to the geometry of the collagen matrix, and that analogous amplified movements may drive morphological changes in other biological meshes, both outside and inside the cell.},
